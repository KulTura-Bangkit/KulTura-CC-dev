    description: 'Ayam bakar is an Indonesian and Malaysian dish, consisting of charcoal-grilled chicken. Ayam bakar literally means "roasted chicken" in Indonesian and Malay. In Java, the chicken is usually marinated with the mixture of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) and coconut oil, applied with a brush during grilling. The bumbu spice mixture may vary among regions, but usually it consists of combination of ground shallot, garlic, chilli pepper, coriander, tamarind juice, candlenut, turmeric, galangal and salt. In Java, ayam bakar usually tastes rather sweet because of the generous amount of sweet soy sauce either as marination or dipping sauce, while the ayam bakar Padang, Bali, Lombok and most of Sumatra are usually spicier and more reddish in colour due to the generous amount of chilli pepper, turmeric and other spices, and the absence of sweet soy sauce. The chicken pieces are usually partially cooked in the spice mixture using a small fire prior to grilling, in order for the chicken to absorb the spices. During grilling process the remaining spices are applied upon the chicken. Ayam bakar is usually served with sambal terasi (chilli with terasi) or sambal kecap (sliced chilli and shallot in sweet soy sauce) as dipping sauce or condiment and slices of cucumber and tomato as garnishing.',

    description: 'Bandeng presto is a typical Indonesian food originating from Juwana District, Pati Regency, Central Java and Gresik, East Java. This dish is made from milkfish (Chanos chanos) seasoned with garlic, turmeric and salt.This milkfish is then cooked on a banana leaf base in a pressure cooker. Presto is a method of cooking with high pressure steam. Food cooked this way is placed in a pan that can be locked tightly. The water in this pot is then heated until it boils. The water vapor that arises will cook the food in this pan. Because milkfish are known to have many spines, pressure cookers are a favorite food because with this method of cooking, these spines become very soft.',
